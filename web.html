        <p class="description">We offer a full array of developement, design, and maintenance services for your website.
            Take your business or event to the next level with our full service offerings. We can do static pages that
            will advertise your business or event. We can help you track and communicate with customers or participants.
            We can set up systems to collect payment for services or donations. From frontend to full stack, we can do
            it all. The examples below are just simple versions of the things we can do for you and your team.</p>

        <h3>Business/Purchasing Site</h3>
        <div class="folio">
            <p>This is a website I build for a business consulting firm. It is largely static, but includes information for a conference they are hosting in the near future. It links to their ticket purchasing system (via Stripe) so users can buy a ticket for the conference. The email links open the user's email server and they can send a message. The "Book an Appointment" link connects to the client's scheduling service.<br>

        <h3>Technical Documentation/Education</h3>
        <div class="folio">
            <p>This is an example of a page designed to outline a process or list a series of events. It is a brief
                explanation of some of the basics of the Python coding language. It can very easily be expanded to cover
                more in depth ideas and processes, as well as cover multiple pages and include video content.

            <p>This is a short video outlining a data management app I have been working on. It is based on software I
                used as a school band director. This is still a work in progress. Similar functionality can be created
                for your business or personal needs.</p>
